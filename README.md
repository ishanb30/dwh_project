# dwh_project
A learning project exploring the basic structure of a data warehouse

## context
This project is being built alongside a tutorial to understand core data warehousing concepts. 
It focuses on how raw data is organised into distinct layers, how transformations are applied 
between those layers, and how analytical queries are supported by the final schema.

The tutorial introduces common warehouse patterns such as staging and analytical layers, 
basic dimensional modelling, and SQL-based transformations that move data from raw inputs 
to queryable tables.
